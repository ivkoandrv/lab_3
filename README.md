# Practice work
# Parallel computing based on multithreaded programming

## Instructions for work:
In each option, you need to write a multithreaded version of the program in one of the modern programming languages (Java, C#, ...) and specify its acceleration on several test examples.

## Task (Variant 1)
Given a rectangular numerical matrix m x n. Write a parallel program for finding a pair of lines whose scalar product is the smallest.

I preferred Go Lang to solve this practice.
To run each program you need to install Golang and run `go run main.go` inside each folder
